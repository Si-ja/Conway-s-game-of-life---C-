# Conway's Game of Life in C#

This is a relatively simple example of the Conway's Game of Life that I wanted to make in C# for quite some time. 

At the current stage, the cells that can be either alive or not are generated randomly or with new update drawn by the user (individually), so
that the game could be simulated from any step the user wants to begin in any position of the cells.

To draw for yourself, do note that the field needs to be first generated, otherwise nothing can be drawn, as there is no selectable space
or specifically no grid to work on.

Update: Ability added for the user to draw cells in either alive or not state.
