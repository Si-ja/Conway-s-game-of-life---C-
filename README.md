# Conway's Game of Life in C#

This is a relatively simple example of the Conway's Game of Life that I wanted to make in C# for quite some time. At the current
stage, the cell that can be either alive or not are generated randomly, where in the future there can be seen reason to make cells
selectable (and/our updatable) to allow for the user to chose on their own how they want the game to start.
